---

Warrior Scheduler is a scheduling application for UH's gym. I worked on this project with two partners.
  
We thought since the UH gym is so busy and it is hard to find open equipment it would be helpful to have
an application to organize gym time. We originally planned to have every user's schedule overlapping on the
calendar but only one is shown at a time.
  
My job was to integrate the Full Calendar Javscript library into our own application. With it, the user is able to drag and drop events, insert new events and delete old events. The events are then stored into a MongoDB collection for each user signed in.
  
Each user can also fill out personal information for their account. This feature is not completely implemented as of yet.
