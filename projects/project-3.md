summary: A Scheme interpreter.
---
  I am currently involved in a student project hosted by the Electrical Engineering Department at UH Manoa to create a
Scheme to C compiler. The project is split into two semesters. The first semester involves implementing a Scheme interpreter. It is
organized into three different teams. The teams are Parsing/IO, Core Systems, and Testing and Design. I have joined the Parsing/IO
team. 
	
  There are 3 main reasons I've decided to join the project. First I think this project will help me gain deeper insight
into how and why programming languages are designed the way they are. I also think that a better understanding of compilers will
help me to write code in a way that allows the compiler to do its optimizations. Most importantly I will be working with a team of
fellow programmers on a nontrivial project, which is something I have never done before.

  I chose to join the parsing team because in past personal projects I have often had to convert data from a file that is
formatted in a certain way into a different data structure that was compatible with my own program. A good example is when I first
had to load 3D models from Wavefront OBJ files into my OpenGL program. The format of the geometric data needed to be processed and
restructured before it could be used by OpenGL and sent to the GPU. Although, now I just use the Assimp library. By working on the
parser for Shaka Scheme I believe such tasks will be easier in the future.
