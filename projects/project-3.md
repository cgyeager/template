Warrior Scheduler is a scheduling application for UH's gym. I worked on this project with two partners.

My job was to integrate the Full Calendar Javscript library into our own application. With it, the user is able to drag and drop events, insert new events and delete old events. The events are then stored into a MongoDB collection for each user signed in.
