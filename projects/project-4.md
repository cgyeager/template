summary: A custom voxel game engine.
---

This is a custom game engine built on top of Monogame. It's using custom shaders in HLSL. The purpose of this project
is to learn how voxels work in computer graphics and how to render them as box like meshes (like Minecraft). I've been teaching myself
computer graphics on the side for about a year now and this is my first real project that is more than just shader effects
and rendering demos. I'm using Monogame so I don't have to deal with any boilerplate code for DirectX and OpenGL. After 
the main components of the engine are finished I will use it to create a simple multiplayer demo game to show off in my 
portfolio for applying to jobs in the games industry. I am no longer updating the source code to github.
