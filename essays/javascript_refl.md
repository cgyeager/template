I think Javascript is an interesting langauge so far. I'm not used to weakly typed languages and it feels a little strange but I
will get used to it in time. I like that it is easy to learn and easy to use, unlike C++ which is what I normally use. I've lost
many hours to strange errors in C++.
	
I must confess, one thing that I'm really excited about with Javascript is using WebGL. The first thing I did after learning the
basics of Javascript was to get a rotating triangle on my web browser. I was suprising at how much faster it is to use WebGL than
it is using OpenGL with C or C++. Once I become more proficient in Javascript I think will do all my prototyping in WebGL.

I'm currently taking the software engineering course at UH Manoa and the professor is having the students do something called
Workout of the Day. It's basically an timed programming exercise. I think WODs will be a useful exercise. I know some software
engineering jobs out there like to test potential recruits with programming exercises and I think the pressure put on us to
finish a working program in a short amount of time is good practice. Also during the first WOD I realized I didn't know how to
manipulate Javascript strings. I took a leap of faith and treated the string like an array. It worked!
