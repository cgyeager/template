  I’ve recently began learning a UI framework for front end web development called Semantic UI. 
Like any good framework, it provides higher productivity at the cost of a learning curve and some 
loss of flexibility. I’ve also been learning html and css, and I have to say, I would much 
rather go through the process of learning a framework like Semantic UI. With Semantic I can 
produce a decent looking webpage within a short amount of time. The syntax takes a little 
getting use to but for the most part it is intuitive enough where I don’t need to try so hard 
to memorize everything. It comes naturally with practice.
	
  My short experience with developing user interfaces for the web has led me to realize I don’t 
want to go into web development. At least not front end. Pushing images and text around a web 
page feels a little dull to me and I’d much rather think about data structures and algorthims. 
I suppose I’m an engineer at heart. I also realize that interfaces are an important part 
of software engineering. Not just user interfaces but interfaces for other programmers. 
	
  When I learn a new API or framework I expect to have an interface that is easily understood. I 
should be able to read the function signature and understand what it does. The less I need to 
look at the documentation is better and is a sign of a well designed API. Designing good APIs is 
one of the most important things I hope to learn as a software engineer.
