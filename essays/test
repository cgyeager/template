My only experience with configuration management has been with git and Github. 
I've personally only used it so I could easily work on the same source code 
using two different machines, my laptop and desktop. Using it this way is 
convenient but not necessary since until now all my projects have been personal.

I recently joined a project to code a Scheme interpreter with a team of 16 other
students. I think this is where I will experience the true power of git. I
really can't imagine trying to work on a project with this many people without
some sort of tool to help us coordinate the work. 

I think the reason that Github is so popular is because of git. I remember a few
times where I was trying download some open source code from Sourceforge only to
find all the code had been replaced by a little note saying "Moved to github". 
Github is also a great place to store code to show what you can do for future
employers. I look forward to making many more contributions to my own public
Github repositories.
