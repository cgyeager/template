Lately I have been learning a web framework called Meteor. Although I have experience with 
several frameworks, such as LibGDX for Java and Qt for C++,  neither of those were for the 
web. Meteor has been a different experience altogether. 

  Learning Meteor has been a challenge. First off, web development is still new to me and 
I’m still trying to get the hang of it. Now add in the complexity of learning a new framework 
and there you have it. The way I have been learning Meteor is by watching different tutorials 
and programming along with them. After I finished the entire tutorial, I then go back and try 
to do the entire project myself and only refer to the documentation for Meteor when I get 
stuck. Slowly but surely all the dots have been connected in my brain and my workflow is 
speeding up.

While learning Meteor I was using a basic template provided by the professor of ICS 314 and 
it was confusing initially, because  the different files seemed scattered about. After working 
with it long enough, making mistakes and figuring out those mistakes I was able to get a good 
understanding of how the project was structured.

Just for fun, I recently starting playing around with the Django web framework made for Python. 
The frameworks are a bit different but there are also similarities as well. Meteor feels easier 
to learn and is also faster getting a basic project up and running. It’s also nice that it can 
use Javascript for both front end and back end.
	
  Overall I think Meteor is a good framework and I look forward to making some interesting applications with it.
