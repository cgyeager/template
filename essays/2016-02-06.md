  I first started programming as a hobby while I was in the Navy working in a system admistration position. I wasn’t very good and
all I really did was write simple scripts and the occasional arcade game. After a while I began to take it more seriously and I realized that I wanted to do it as a career, so I decided to go back to school. 

  So far I’ve never had any formal training in software development but over time I have developed a mental model of how software
is created. To me it is like pottery. You have the wheel (the iterative process) that you use to spin the clay (data) while your
hands form it into a shape (algorithms). This is why I love software. It’s an art.

  In the future I hope to become better at managing large code bases and more importantly I would like to become better at working
with other people in the development process. I am extremely motivated and I am constantly reading books about different subjects
in computer science and software in general outside of class. I also work on projects outside of class to hone my skills. In
short, my goal is to become an expert.
