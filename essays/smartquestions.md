Asking smart questions is an important skill for any software engineer. Nowhere is this more evident 
than on the Stack Overflow Q/A website. A quick peruse through and one can quickly find both  smartly 
asked questions and some, well, not so smart.

One question I found was asking about object slicing in C++. I thought it was a smart question because 
it was short and to the point. The asker also explained that they did try to look up an acceptable answer 
before asking but couldn’t find one. The question had 424 upvotes and received several good answers. It 
also generated a lot of conversation between other developers in the comments section.

One question I had found had 13 downvotes, several impolite comments and no accepted answer. The asker was 
asking about a hypothetical error that could occur in some PHP code and was asking for someone to come up 
with some example code to help him understand how the error could occur. The commenters told him to just 
write the code to test it himself. Basically, the asker was looking for someone else to do the work for 
him. Definitately not a great question.

My question was not terrible because I was very succint in getting my point across. I copied and pasted the
snippet of code I was working on to show what I was working with and the problem was very specific so I 
couldn't really look anything up on it to help. It wasn't great either. It was a silly problem that I should 
have easily noticed. Yet I didn't recieve any snarky remarks either, so that's always good.

It’s easy to see just from these two questions that asking the right question the right way will provide 
better answers instead of rude comments from developers who feel like you’ve wasted their time.
